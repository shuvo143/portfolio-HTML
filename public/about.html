    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Hello! I'm Shahriar Faysal Ferdous, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with you. </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">I have always been passionate about computer science, and this passion has driven me to grow utmost interests on machine learning, 
    deep learning, web development etc.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of my defining characteristics is my insatiable curiosity, which keeps me constantly exploring new horizons. 
    I believe that life is an incredible journey filled with opportunities for growth and learning, and I'm committed to 
    making the most of every moment.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">My educational journey started at Cantonment Public School & College, Mymensingh, where I completed my Secondary School Certificate 
    (SSC) in 2015 with a perfect GPA of 5.00 out of 5.00 in the Science Group. Following that, I pursued my Higher Secondary Certificate 
    (HSC) at Notre Dame College, Dhaka, Bangladesh, achieving a GPA of 5.00 out of 5.00 in 2017, still within the Science Group. 
    Currently, I am working towards my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Computer Science & Engineering, which I began at Rajshahi 
    University of Engineering and Technology in January 2018, with an expected graduation in 2023. This diverse educational background 
    has equipped me with a strong foundation, allowing me to develop valuable skills and knowledge in the field of Computer Science and 
    Engineering, and has paved the way for my career aspirations.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When I'm not immersed in studying, coding or researching, you can often find me listening to music, watching thriller movies or
    travelling. I find inspiration in nature, art and the kindness of others, and I believe  that these experiences enrich my life and 
    creativity.</p>
   
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a student of computer science, I'm excited about the future and the possibilities it holds. I look forward to building meaningful
    projects, making a positive impact on my community and expanding my skillset.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I'm always open to new connections and opportunities, so feel free to reach 
    out and start a conversation. Let's embark on this journey of life and learning together!</p>
